## Description:
* With its large and unstructured data, MongoDB makes it a top pick for social networks. To meet the challenge of building a social network web app API. We'll employ Express.js for routing, leverage a MongoDB database and utilize Mongoose ODM. Additionally, we'll integrate a JavaScript date library to utilize the native Date object for timestamp formatting.

* BONUS COMPLETED: Application deletes a user's associated thoughts when the user is deleted. Feature to remove a user's associated thoughts when deleted.
